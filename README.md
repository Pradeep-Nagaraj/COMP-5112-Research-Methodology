## Ethical Hacking : A Review on Tools,Techniques and Approaches

# Project Description

Hacking, specifically cracking computer systems, is the primary cause of this insecurity. Hacking is a procedure in which an individual or group exploits a system’s flaw for personal gain or enjoyment. Ethical hacking is the technique of breaking into a network with good intentions and in an ethical manner to protect the system from being hacked. For organizations and governments, ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or intrusion testing, has become a major concern. Companies are concerned about being “hacked”, while potential customers are concerned about keeping control of their personal information.

# Philosophy

The internet has accelerated the digitalization of several activities such as banking, online purchases, online financial transactions, collaborative computing, e-mail, and new avenues for advertising, information distribution, and data gathering. With the rapid development of the internet and the increasing number of users, the risk of data security is increasing, and the problem of information security is becoming extremely important. Because most technical advancements have made all information available online, some people use it to gain knowledge, while others use it to disrupt or steal information from websites or databases without the owner's knowledge. HACKING is the terminology used for this dark side. Hacking is the alteration of computer hardware, software, or networks to achieve goals that are not aligned with the interests of the users.

Despite the fact that internet security is improving, hackers continue to find ways to breach systems. As a result, the need to protect systems from hackers necessitates the promotion of Ethical Hackers, who will fight back against illegal attacks on our computer systems. Ethical hacking is the process of examining security flaws and identifying prospective security vulnerabilities for an organization in charge of the information technology environment under attack [3]. Ethical hackers utilize the same methods to evaluate a security system as their less ethical counterparts, but instead of exploiting flaws, they report them. Ethical hacking and penetration testing are often used interchangeably since they are so closely related. There is, however, a narrow line of distinction between these two terms [4]. Penetration testing is a term that refers to the process of detecting vulnerabilities, dangers, and target environments in order to secure and take control of a system. Ethical hacking, on the other hand, is a broad concept that encompasses all hacking techniques as well as other computer attack strategies. So, in addition to identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities and verifying the target system's security, it goes beyond hacking the system but with authorization to protect the security for future purposes. In general, to carry out tasks, an ethical hacker will need access to each of an organization's systems, whereas a pentester simply needs access to the area of interest.

# Research Questions:

 RQ1: Who are Ethical Hacker's and what they do? <br>
 RQ2: Why do we need Ethical Hackers? <br>
 RQ3: How Ethical hackers approach towards finding intruders? <br>
 RQ4: Is Ethical Hacking “Ethical”? <br>
