## Ethical Hacking : A Review on Tools,Techniques and Approaches

# Project Description

Hacking, specifically cracking computer systems, is the primary cause of this insecurity. Hacking is a procedure in which an individual or group exploits a system’s flaw for personal gain or enjoyment. Ethical hacking is the technique of breaking into a network with good intentions and in an ethical manner to protect the system from being hacked. For organizations and governments, ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or intrusion testing, has become a major concern. Companies are concerned about being “hacked”, while potential customers are concerned about keeping control of their personal information.
