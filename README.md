## Ethical Hacking : A Review on Tools,Techniques and Approaches

# Project Description

Hacking, specifically cracking computer systems, is the primary cause of this insecurity. Hacking is a procedure in which an individual or group exploits a system’s flaw for personal gain or enjoyment. Ethical hacking is the technique of breaking into a network with good intentions and in an ethical manner to protect the system from being hacked. For organizations and governments, ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or intrusion testing, has become a major concern. Companies are concerned about being “hacked”, while potential customers are concerned about keeping control of their personal information.

# Philosophy

Despite the fact that internet security is improving, hackers continue to find ways to breach systems. As a result, the need to protect systems from hackers necessitates the promotion of Ethical Hackers, who will fight back against illegal attacks on our computer systems. Ethical hacking is the process of examining security flaws and identifying prospective security vulnerabilities for an organization in charge of the information technology environment under attack. Ethical hackers utilize the same methods to evaluate a security system as their less ethical counterparts, but instead of exploiting flaws, they report them. Ethical hacking and penetration testing are often used interchangeably since they are so closely related. There is, however, a narrow line of distinction between these two terms. Penetration testing is a term that refers to the process of detecting vulnerabilities, dangers, and target environments in order to secure and take control of a system. Ethical hacking, on the other hand, is a broad concept that encompasses all hacking techniques as well as other computer attack strategies. So, in addition to identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities and verifying the target system's security, it goes beyond hacking the system but with authorization to protect the security for future purposes. In general, to carry out tasks, an ethical hacker will need access to each of an organization's systems, whereas a pentester simply needs access to the area of interest.

### Ethical Hacking Tools
**Name**  |  **Description**
----  |  ----
IP lookup |	Allows the identification of the IP in use with a geographical location
MAC lookup |	Allows the identification of the type of the device and the manufacturer
BSSID |	Used to identify a particular BSS (Basic Service Set) within an area based on geographically locating the device in real time
Maltego	| Used to correlate and determine relationships between people, names, phone numbers, email addresses, companies, organizations and social network profiles.
AirCrack-ng |	It works by collecting network packets and then analysing and using them to break Wifi access. It has complete support for 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK networks It works by capturing network packets and then analysing and using them to crack Wifi access.
Angry IP scanner |	Scans for online IPs and available hosts within a small range, medium range and up to a broadcast range (single or multi IP scan)
Nmap |	Network Mapper used for network discovery along security auditing
Znmap |	GUI Nmap version for network diagnosis
Tracert |	Ensures a network analysis and diagnosis, identifies the track of the sent packet from an IP address to another.
